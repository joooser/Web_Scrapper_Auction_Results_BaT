# Web_Scrapper_Auction_Results_BaT
I got a entrepreneurshipmnet with my buddy Alberto, we restore classic cars, so we were talking about a few days ago 
about the probability of getting proffit with porshe 356 speedsters replicas getting sold in the United states Market. 
So, I Made a simply web scrapper using jupyter notebooks for getting the data about the results of all the Actions in our favorite
auctions site BaT so there is the repository about it.
