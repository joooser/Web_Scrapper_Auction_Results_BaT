# Web_Scrapper_Auction_Results_BaT
I got a entrepreneurshipmnet with my buddy Alberto, We restore classic cars in order to sell them for a profit, so we were talking a few days ago 
about the probability of getting profit with Porshe 356 speedsters replicas getting sold in the United States Market. 
So, I Made a simply web scrapper using jupyter notebooks for getting the data about the results of all the Actions in our favorite
auctions site BaT so there is the repository about it.
then we will need to calculate production cost of every replica and shipment.
